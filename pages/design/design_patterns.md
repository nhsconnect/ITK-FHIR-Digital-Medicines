# Patterns #

This section has been included to emphasise the use of design patterns in to the process of deciding how to use ITK3 eDischarge within ITK3 Messaging Solutions. The information has been taken from [developer.nhs.uk](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/architecture/integration-patterns/information-sharing-patterns-summary/).

## Overview ## 

A “pattern” is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise for example in the case of an ITK3 Messaging Solution sharing clinical information between systems. The information in this section has been reproduced and shortened from [developer.nhs.uk](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/architecture/integration-patterns/information-sharing-patterns-summary/)
- Patterns are not mutually exclusive: many real solutions will use more than one pattern.
- Solutions may evolve from simpler to more complex patterns over time.
- Some patterns will be better for specific sharing needs than others – there is no “one size fits all”.
- Some patterns will scale better to larger populations.
- Some patterns require additional capabilities or services to be in place.

## List of patterns ##

Below is a list of patterns. If you require more detail please go to [developer.nhs.uk](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/architecture/integration-patterns/information-sharing-patterns-summary/) and click on the pattern for more information.

# Patterns and ITK3 eDischarge Based ITK3 Messaging Solutions  #

Considering the design pattern / topology influences how any exposed ITK3 eDischarge based ITK3 Messaging Solutions can be used and work within a system. ITK3 Messaging Solutions help to expose information to all design patterns allowing great user experiences to be created quickly, securely and consistantly. This implementation guide concentrates on [Case Studies](/engage_case_studies.html) to expose and demonstrate how design pattern can use ITK3 eDischarge ITK3 Messaging Solutions to interoperate with other systems, patterns, and level of digital maturity within and between organisations.
